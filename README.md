# AIGotchi
We are presenting an AI powered remake of the famous legendary mind blowing game Tamagotchi - AIGotchi.
It is created not only for fun. Every kid loves playing games. Our characters - the cutest pets in the world have to be fed by virtual fruits. And to get those fruits, our small users have to perform tasks.
There are three subjects: math, geography and English.
And also don't forget about a healthy lifestyle! Our game is connected to a smartphone's pedometer and it stimulates a small user to walk. Like people say “I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees”
Our game not only develops your kid’s mind and body, but forms responsibility for another being, makes the child less aggressive, more responsible and develops emotional intelligence and communication skills.

AIGotchi works only on Android devices. But soon it will be availiable on iphones also. 
We use the telegram interface, but you have to set up our application, if you want to get additional points for walking. But if you don’t, you may not install it. 
You can breed your pets. For this purpose you have to find your friend who also plays this game and make breeding, After the breeding one of us (chosen randomly) gets a new AIGotchi, but it can be activated on another device. It means, you cannot hold two AIGothcis at the same time. You can just present your AIGotchi’s child to someone else. 
If you miss or ignore 3 messages from your AIGotchi, it will die. 

This is just an MVP built in out of hours to show the concept. We want to add more topics like math, botanics and physics, Also we want to add an apk for i-os. And we will link our AIgotchis to NFTs to be transferable.
